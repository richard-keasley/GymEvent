<p>Ensure you complete the contact details correctly.</p>

<p>You can paste the participant details from BG GymNet. If you don't know a  participant's BG number, enter a 'place marker' of "1" (.e.g <code>John, Doe, 1, 12 Oct 70</code>).</p>

<p>We need this information to verify your membership status with BG and to ensure participants are entered in to the correct category. Read our <?php echo anchor(base_url('about/policy'), 'privacy policy');?> for more information.</p>  

<p>Be aware each participant box may contain many participants. However, each box is <em>only one entry</em>. Be sure there is only one gymnast in each box unless your discipline has many gymnasts in a single entry. Examples of this include Acrobatic pairs (2 gymnasts), Team-gym, etc.</p>

<p>The payment section will not be updated until you save the page.</p>
